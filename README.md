Create an arithmetic progression with the formula a_n = 3 + 2(n+1)

Example how a arithmetic progression works :
For n = 3
a_0 = 3 + 2(0+1) = 3 + 2*1 = 3 + 2 = 5  = а_0
а_1 = 3 + 2(1+1) = 3 + 2*2 = 3 + 4 = 7  = а_1
а_2 = 3 + 2(2+1) = 3 + 2*3 = 3 + 6 = 9  = а_2 
а_3 = 3 + 2(3+1) = 3 + 2*4 = 3 + 8 = 11 = а_3

Print on the console the formula a_n = 3 + 2(n+1)
Print on the console n.
Print on the console every element from a_0 to a_n.
Print on the console sum of all elements.
Print on the console sum of all elements which can be devided by 5.

Input parameters :
n -> Enter n from the console in has to be a positive integer between [0, 10000]

Example output for input n = 3 :
Formula : a_n = 3 + 2(n+1)
N = 3
a_0 = 5
a_1 = 7
a_2 = 9
a_3 = 11
Sum of all elements : 32
Sum of all elements that can be devided by 5 : 5
